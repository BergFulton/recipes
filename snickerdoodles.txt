This is from Instructables.com! The absolute BEST snickerdoodle recipe ever. 

Snickerdoodles are great cookies, and this is my favorite snickerdoodle recipe. Any cookie with this much butter and sugar has got to be good!

This Snickerdoodle recipe is from our friend Sneaker's mother, thus the name. I've tried other versions, but they're not nearly as good. These cookies start out fantastically soft and chewy in the middle, and become delightfully crisp overnight. The best of both worlds.

Here I've given the base set of ingredients, all ready for substitution. Note that this snickerdoodle recipe is a perfect base for making SnickerPoodles.
